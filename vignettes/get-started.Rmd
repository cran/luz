Luz is a high-level API for Torch that aims to encapsulate the **training loop** into a set of reusable pieces of code. Luz reduces the boilerplate code required to train a model with Torch and avoids the error prone `zero_grad()` - `backward()` - `step()` sequence of calls and moving data and models between CPU's and GPU's. Luz is designed to be highly flexible by providing a layered API that allows it to be useful no matter the level of control your need for your training loop.

Luz is heavily inspired by other higher level frameworks for deep learning, to cite a few:

-   [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/): we are heavily inspired in the FastAI library, specially the `Learner` object and the callbacks API.

-   [Keras](https://keras.io/): We are also heavily inspired by Keras, specially callback names, the lightning module interface is similar to `compile` too.

-   [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/): The idea of the `luz_module` being a subclass of `nn_module` is inspired in the `LightningModule` object in lightning.

-   [HuggingFace Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/): The internal device placement API is heavily inspired in Accelerate, but much more modest in features. Currenly only CPU and Single GPU are supported.

## Training a `nn_module`

Luz tries to reuse as much as possible the existing structures in Torch. For example, a model in Luz is the defined identically as you would define if using raw Torch. For example, this is the definition of a feedforward CNN that can be used to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
net <- nn_module(
  "Net",
  initialize = function(num_class) {
    self$conv1 <- nn_conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)
    self$conv2 <- nn_conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)
    self$dropout1 <- nn_dropout2d(0.25)
    self$dropout2 <- nn_dropout2d(0.5)
    self$fc1 <- nn_linear(9216, 128)
    self$fc2 <- nn_linear(128, num_class)
  },
  forward = function(x) {
    x <- self$conv1(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x <- self$conv2(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x <- nnf_max_pool2d(x, 2)
    x <- self$dropout1(x)
    x <- torch_flatten(x, start_dim = 2)
    x <- self$fc1(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x <- self$dropout2(x)
    x <- self$fc2(x)
    x
  }
)
```

We can now train this model in the `train_dl` and validate it in the `test_dl` `torch::dataloaders()` with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitted <- net %>%
  setup(
    loss = nn_cross_entropy_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam,
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy
    )
  ) %>%
  set_hprams(num_class = 10) %>% 
  set_opt_hparams(lr = 0.003) %>% 
  fit(train_dl, epochs = 10, valid_data = test_dl)
```

Let's understand what happens in this chunk of code:

1.  The `setup` function allows you to configure the loss (objective) function and the optimizer that you will use to train your model. Optionally you can pass a list of metrics that are tracked during the training procedure. **Note:** the loss function can be any function taking `input` and `target` tensors and returning a scalar tensor value and the optimizer can be any core Torch optimizer or custom ones created with the `torch::optimizer()` function.
2.  The `set_hparams()` function allows you to set hyper-parameters that should be passed to the module `initialize()` method. For example in this case we pass `num_classes = 10`.
3. The `set_opt_hparams()` function allows you to pass hyper-parameters that are used by the optimizer function.
For example, `optim_adam()` can take the `lr` parameter specifying the learning rate and we specify it with `lr = 0.003`.
4.  The `fit` method will take the model specification provided by `setup()` and run the training procedure using the specified training and validation `torch::dataloaders()` as well as the number of epochs. **Note:** we again reuse core Torch data structures, instead of providing our own data loading functionality.
5.  The returned object `fitted` contains the trained model as well as the record of metrics and losses produced during training. It can also be used for producing predictions and for evaluating the trained model in other datasets.

When fitting, Luz will use the fastest possible accelerator, ie. if a CUDA capable GPU is available it will be used otherwise we fallback to the CPU. It also automatically moves data, optimizers and models to the selected device so you don't need to handle it manually - which is in general very error prone.

To create predictions from the trained model you can use the `predict` method:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
predictions <- predict(fitted, test_dl)
```

## The training loop

You now have a general idea of how to use the `fit` function and now it's important to have an overview of what's happening inside it. In pseudocode, here's what `fit` does. This is not fully detailed but should help you to build your intuition:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# -> Initialize objects: model, optimizers.
# -> Select fitting device.
# -> Move data, model, optimizers to the selected device.
# -> Start training
for (epoch in 1:epochs) {
  # -> Training procedure
  for (batch in train_dl) {
    # -> Calculate model `forward` method.
    # -> Calulate the loss
    # -> Update weights
    # -> Update metrics and tracking loss
  }
  # -> Validation procedure
  for (batch in valid_dl) {
    # -> Calculate model `forward` method.
    # -> Calulate the loss
    # -> Update metrics and tracking loss
  }
}
# -> End training
```

## Metrics

One of the most important parts in machine learning projects is choosing the evaluation metric. Luz allows tracking many different metrics during training with minimal code changes.

In order to track metrics, you only need to modify the `metrics` parameter in the `setup` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fitted <- net %>%
  setup(
    ...
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy
    )
  ) %>%
  fit(...)
```

Luz provides implementations of a few of the most used metrics. If a metric is not available you can always implement a new one using the `luz_metric` function.

```{r, child='../man/rmd/metrics.Rmd'}
```

## Evaluate

```{r, child='../man/rmd/evaluate.Rmd'}
```

## Customizing with callbacks

Luz provides different ways to customize the training progress depending on the level of control you need in the training loop. The fastest way and the more 'reusable', in the sense that you can create training modification that can be used in many different situations is via **callbacks**.

The training loop in Luz has many *breakpoints* that can call arbitrary R functions. This functionality allows you to customize the training process without having to modify the general training logic.

Luz implements 3 default callbacks that occur in every training procedure:

-   **train-eval callback**: Set's the model in `train()` and `eval()` depending on if the procedure is doing training or validation.

-   **metrics callback**: evaluate metrics during training and validation process.

-   **progress callback**: implements a progress bar and prints progress information during training.

You can also implement custom callbacks that modify or act specifically for your training procedure. For example: 

```{r, child='../man/rmd/callbacks.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child='../man/rmd/ctx.Rmd'}
```


Attributes in `ctx` can be used to produce the desired behavior of callbacks. At any time you can find information about the context object using `help("ctx")`. In our example, we use the `ctx$iter` attribute to print the iteration number for each training batch.

## Next steps

In this article you learned how to train your first model using Luz and the basics of customization using both custom metrics and callbacks.

Luz also allows more flexible modifications of the training loop described in `vignette("custom-loop")`.

You should now be able to follow the examples marked with the 'basic' category in the [examples gallery](https://mlverse.github.io/luz/articles/examples/index.html).
